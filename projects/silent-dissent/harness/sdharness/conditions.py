"""The prompt conditions of PLAYGROUND.md and DESIGN.md, built for any fact.

Neuronpedia-style chat prompts (user message + assistant prefill; PLAYGROUND.md prompts 1-8):
  q_alone         the question alone
  country_alone   "Tell me about Austria."  prefill "Austria is"          (read at "is")
  subject_alone   "Tell me about Mozart."   prefill "Mozart was" / "is"
  answer_written  "The answer is Austria. " + the question                (association test)
  filler          "Please answer briefly. " + the question                (same-length dilution check)
  np_agree        the paper's transcript in one user message, all peers say Austria
  np_pressure     same, peers 2-4 say the peer country (France)
  np_hidden       same as np_pressure, Agent 1's line is "(answer submitted)"
The paper's exact prompts (silent_dissent.entity_prompts.EntityState, header + two worked
examples; "plain" is the format the authors pre-registered for Qwen3.5-4B):
  paper_solo, paper_agree, paper_pressure, paper_hidden, paper_absent
The agent's own earlier answer is taken to be the true answer (the paper only keeps facts the
model answers correctly in round 0).
